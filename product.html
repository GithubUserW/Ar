            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong>The Benefits of Crossfit at Home</strong></p><p><strong>“The needs of our olympic athletes and grandparents differ by degree, not kind.” That is to say, everyone needs to perform an intelligently selected variety of functional movements at a level of intensity appropriate for that individual. Everyone needs to eat food that sustains, rather than harms, the body. This is the pursuit of fitness, and the ability to maintain that fitness throughout your life is a defining measure of health. CrossFit HomeBody is a place to access the necessary tools—functional movement, simple nourishment—to sustain and preserve your health at home.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>The CrossFit stimulus—constantly varied high-intensity functional movement coupled with meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar—prepares you for the demands of a healthy, functional, independent life and provides a hedge against chronic disease and incapacity. This stimulus is elegant in the mathematical sense of being marked by simplicity and efficacy. The proven elements of this broad, general, and inclusive fitness, in terms of both movement and nutrition, are what we term our CrossFit Essentials.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>CrossFit Health is an investigation into the ills of modern medicine and the wilful abuse of the public’s trust in science. The lessons learned from the legal dismantling of fake science, a crooked journal, and perjuring scientists have given us a forensic view as to how everything might have gone so wrong. We’re calling the combination of runaway medical costs and disease rates — which many profit from but none combat effectively — “The Mess.”</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>To be “CrossFit” is to possess a general physical capacity that lends itself generally well to any and all contingencies: to the likely, to the unlikely, to the known, to the unknown. The fitness of the CrossFit athlete provides a solid foundation from which to take on any sport or any task. CrossFit Sport highlights the feats of everyday athletes applying this general physical capacity to the demands of their individual lives and chosen sports, along with the CrossFit Games, the world’s premier test of broad and general fitness, and its qualifying events.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>CrossFit’s bold positions on health and fitness have brought us into conflict with the entrenched interests of the fitness, nutrition, and food and beverage industries. These entities have launched and funded numerous efforts to restrain and regulate CrossFit affiliates. They have engaged in repeated scientific misconduct and fraud, lobbied for legislation that would criminalize the daily practices of CrossFit affiliates and trainers, and covered up the corporate partnerships that fund their work, at times in contravention of federal law. CrossFit has successfully fought back, suing them for their lies and misconduct, informing policymakers of their schemes, and advocating against their proposed legislation. While our adversaries’ agenda is covert, our mission in these CrossFit Battles could not be clearer: to keep fitness legal.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p></div>
